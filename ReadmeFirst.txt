                Experimental for Muki.io. 
This experiment attempts to make muki.io read the .kar, .midi, .rmi files 
and try to display the lyrics as in nfroidure's karaoke.insertafter.com. 

Unfortunately it is very difficult to synchronize time and lyrics because 
nfroidure has a player that accesses internal midi driver in the form of 
a plugin from coolsoft atai jazz, while muki.io player is a timidity that 
converts midi to audio by utilizing arachno-based soundfont modified. 
This experiment only stimulates the lovers of Javascript and midi to develop it, 

Mr. Tomas Pollak has seen the gist version.

because I slowly began to understand the use of Github directly on the website,
the program I breakdown as much as possible as far as I can understand using
logic and common sense.

But if Mr. Tomas Pollak saw this and did not want it, so as soon as possible
let me know and I will delete it.

note: I really hard to discuss english, the above article using google translation,
